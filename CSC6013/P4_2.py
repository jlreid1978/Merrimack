# Adapt the Maximum Element in an Array algorithm seem to search for the minimum element in the array. Trace your algorithm execution printing:
# at the beginning of each recursive call the start and end values.
# at the returning of each recursive call the returned value (the minimum of the array slice).
# test your algorithm for the arrays:
# A3 = [44, 63, 77, 17, 20, 99, 84, 6, 39, 52]
# A4 = [52, 84, 6, 39, 20, 77, 17, 99, 44, 63]
# A5 = [6, 17, 20, 39, 44, 52, 63, 77, 84, 99]
