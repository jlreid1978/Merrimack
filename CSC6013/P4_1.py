# Adapt the Binary Search algorithm seem in class to search a given element assuming that the array is not in ascending order, but instead it is sorted in descending order. Trace your algorithm execution printing:
# at each recursive call, print the subarray from start to end and show the mid element.
# test your algorithm for the arrays:
# A1 = [99, 67, 56, 51, 44, 39, 38, 23, 21, 17, 11, 2]   searching for 44;
# A1 = [99, 67, 56, 51, 44, 39, 38, 23, 21, 17, 11, 2]   searching for 56;
# A1 = [99, 67, 56, 51, 44, 39, 38, 23, 21, 17, 11, 2]   searching for 42;
# A2 = [9, 7, 6, 4, 2, 0, -1, -3, -5, -8, -9]   searching for -1;
# A2 = [9, 7, 6, 4, 2, 0, -1, -3, -5, -8, -9]   searching for -7.
