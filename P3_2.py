# Adapt the Bubble Sort algorithm seem to stop the outer loop if no swap was made during the last iteration (thus, the array is already sorted). Trace your algorithm execution printing:
# at each iteration of the outer loop count the number of times two array elements are compared and the number of times two array elements were swapped, plus the current status of the array.
# test your algorithm for the arrays:
# A4 = [44, 63, 77, 17, 20, 99, 84, 6, 39, 52]
# A5 = [52, 84, 6, 39, 20, 77, 17, 99, 44, 63]
# A6 = [6, 17, 20, 39, 44, 52, 63, 77, 84, 99]
